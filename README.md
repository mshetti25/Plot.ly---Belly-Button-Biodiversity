# Plot.ly - Belly-Button-Biodiversity

In this project, I have build an interactive dashboard to explore the http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/  which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.
The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.
